Bookshelf Organizer
This Python program organizes a collection of books into shelves based on their categories. It categorizes books into three shelves: one for classic books, another for fantasy books, and a third for other categories. Books within each shelf are sorted alphabetically by title.

To use the program, define your books using the Book class with the title, author, and category attributes. Then, run the organize_books() function, passing a list of Book objects as input. The program will automatically organize the books into shelves and display the sorted shelves with the books.
